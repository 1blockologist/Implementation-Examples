## Custom Pull to Refresh

This is a user experience (UX) tweak that diverges away from the common and default pull to refresh visual elements that users may expect. It allows for more branding and theming to be done where it may not otherwise fit on the layout. A perk here is that more information can also be added, such as words or graphics that tell the user that the application is syncing or loading, while presenting the user with exciting elements to keep their attention and their engagement high.
