# Implementation Examples
Descriptions and visual examples of implementations I've created

## Custom Pull to Refresh

This is a user experience (UX) tweak that diverges away from the common and default pull to refresh visual elements that users may expect. It allows for more branding and theming to be done where it may not otherwise fit on the layout. A perk here is that more information can also be added, such as words or graphics that tell the user that the application is syncing or loading, while presenting the user with exciting elements to keep their attention and their engagement high.

## Stateful Navigation / UI Elements

There are many instances where a lot of functionality is desired that will clutter a screen with static buttons to get the user's attention. UX designers often don't consider element states in their static image designs. Stateful navigation is an improvement to UX where certain visual elements are hidden when they are not relevent to the user. An optimization that the shows or hides information based on what the user is looking at, without requiring the user to touch buttons/symbols that drill them down into other parts of the app.
